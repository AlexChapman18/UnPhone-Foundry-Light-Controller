Signal Strength Bars and WiFi Connection
-----------------------------------------
The signal strength between the WiFi router and the UnPhone is illustrated by signal bars which updates
live on the screen, periodically checking every 5 seconds. This provides the user with guidance if
they are connected to the router, otherwise the lights cannot be controlled.

LVGL GUI Testing
-----------------
The GUI was tested by following the transition diagram described in the User interface section, ensuring all screens
transitioned to the desired state when either the touchscreen or unPhone buttons were pressed.
